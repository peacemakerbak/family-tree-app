        <h1>Family Tree Application</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my Family Tree Application (my first ever project)! This project lets you create and grow your family tree by entering information and sharing links with family members.</p>
            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p><strong>What It Is:</strong> A simple application to build and visualize a family tree.</p>
            <p><strong>Why I Started It:</strong> This was my first project as an engineer, aimed at learning and exploring application development.</p>
            <p><strong>Current Status:</strong> The project is incomplete but functional. It's worth checking out if you're interested in family tree applications. Since then, I've been building more tools and improving my skills.</p>
