Family Tree Application
Welcome to my Family Tree Application (my first ever project)! This project lets you create and grow your family tree by entering information and sharing links with family members.

About the Project
What It Is: A simple application to build and visualize a family tree.
Why I Started It: This was my first project as an engineer, aimed at learning and exploring application development.
Current Status: The project is incomplete but functional. It's worth checking out if you're interested in family tree applications. Since then, I've been building more tools and improving my skills.
